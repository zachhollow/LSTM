# LSTM Forecasting 

## Overview
This repository contains one IPYNB (Jupyter Notebook) file implementing a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for time-series forecasting. The model uses Keras  for forecasting past data.
## Files
- **LSTM-past.ipynb**: This notebook has the LSTM model for forecasting past data. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
  
- **env.py**: This file serves as a template; fill in with your credentials. You can also set up your API ID/secret in bash or advanced system settings.
