# LSTM Forecasting 

## Overview
This repository contains two IPYNB (Jupyter Notebook) files implementing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for time-series forecasting. One model is designed for forecasting past data, while the other focuses on predicting future data.

## Files
- **LSTM-past.ipynb**: This notebook contains the LSTM model for forecasting past data. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

- **LSTM-future.ipynb**: This notebook implements the LSTM model tailored for predicting future data points. It covers data preparation, model training, forecasting, and visualization of forecasted outcomes.
- **env.py**: This file serves as a template; fill in with your credentials. You can also set up your API ID/secret in bash or advanced system settings.
